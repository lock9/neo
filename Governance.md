# Introduction
This document suggests a governance model to be used by the Neo core developers. The goal is to develop a fair model that balances compensation with each individual's responsibilities and outcomes/deliverables. 
This document also suggests the creation of a Core Developer Treasury to maintain the core developer team. 

## Main Issue
Developing a fair plan that balances compensation with each individual's responsibilities and outcomes/deliverables is essential. Stability, fairness, and organization are required to attract and retain talent.

### Existing Problems
We face challenges in our development processes, for example:
- Issues raised that are not relevant to the current objectives of the project. 
- Abandoned issues or PRs.
- Evaluating results based only on PRs.
  - Leading to competition instead of collaboration. 
- A feeling of disorganization.
- Unclear assignment of responsibilities.
  - Who responds to people?
  - Who verifies results?
  - Who does the release?
  - Who details the issues?
  - ...
- Lack of processes leading to poor efficiency
- No overall vision of the code base health.


It looks like, culturally speaking, we are failing to understand this:
**Everything is about people. Software is about people, not code.**

### Understanding People:
- People want to work in a professional and welcoming environment.
- People want to feel safe.
- People want challenges that match their skills.
- People want a sense of professional growth.
- People want to create a legacy.
- People are not the same: different people provide different value
- People want a fair work environment, including fair compensation.
- People need a sense of belonging.
- People don't want and can't be controlled. They need to be convinced.
- People don't like feeling being used.
- People don't like being ignored.
- People like privacy.
- Seasoned developers are older people who demand more stability. 
- People want to see the results of their work.
- We must understand the people using our stuff and how they feel about it.
  - Identify usability improvement points (installation, configuration, etc.).
- We want to attract and retain the best people.
- People prefer teams that work online and asynchronously.
  - Culture compatible with everyone's reality, timezone, etc.
- We want people to deliver their best.
- People expect a long-term vision.
- We want people that aim for the overall network improvement.
- People work better with incentives than punishments.
- People make mistakes, but no one should be negligent or lack general responsibility.

### Proposed Solution: Create a clear Core Developer Team and Treasury
This governance model should embrace both responsibilities and compensations. This relates, but it's not the same as the development process #2955.

#### What to expect from the Core Devs?
We want to build a team of great people so that they can deliver their best.

This means that we expect that:

- The team works professionally and responsibly.
- The team works productively.
- The team works participatively.
- The team is capable of self-management.
  - Planning of features.
  - Bug fixes.
  - Organization of deliveries.
  - Dealing with incidents.
- **The team is capable of governing itself.**
- The team collaborates rather than competes.
- The team communicates their work.
  - Discussion of solutions on GitHub.
  - Creation of in-code documentation.
  - Keep documents and repositories updated and organized.
  - Produce information facts that can be used in web documentation.
    - It's not the developer's responsibility to create end-user documentation, only to provide facts about the functionality and behavior of the code and features.
- The team creates rituals (recurring activities) for information exchange and planning.
- The team collaborates with other working groups.
  - Assist the design team in creating visuals for abstract elements.
  - Help the content team to provide accurate content.
  - Offer integration support to new features
- The team uses dApps built on Neo
- The team creates mechanisms to deter harmful behaviors
  - This should be seen as a governance tool, not a motivation to work

### Core Developer Team

We must offer more than a good working environment to maintain a core developer team with skilled and motivated developers. It's essential to compensate accordingly. To do this transparently, we suggest the creation of a Core Developer Treasury. This treasury is used to compensate core developers for their work.

**Elected core developers can vote on issues and participate in paid reward distributions.**

- Voting can be done on GitHub issues.
- Voting can be done privately on Discord
- Voting is done using emojis: 
  - :thumbsup: : +1
  - :thumbsdown: -1
  - :eyes: 0

#### Core Treasury & Compensation 
The idea is a Core Developer Treasury managed by NGD and maintained by Core Developers. NGD funds the treasury while core developers vote on the rules and perks. 
- A consensus node and private donations fund this treasury to keep core developers connected with the technology and incentivize $GAS consumption. 
- To keep contributors safe, it's recommended to use private channels to discuss monetary values and transactions. 


#### Compensation
Offer a combination of:
- Base Salary
- Rewards
- Perks and Benefits


##### Base Salary

It is necessary to offer stability and retain seasoned developers.

- Should be enough to provide family security.
- Lower than market rates.
  - The goal is to offer a more significant part of the compensation through rewards.  
- Guaranteed during down periods.
- Guaranteed up to 45 days of inactivity.

##### Rewards

Primary reward distribution model.

- Motivate delivery of above-average results.
- Allow for adequate compensation according to each individual's contribution.

##### Perks and Benefits
Perks and other benefits are offered through reimbursements or periodical payments.

- Subsidy for purchasing computer devices and parts.
  - Core developers must have access to the best hardware available on the market 
- Airfare and hotel for travel and related events.
- Leisure allowance.
- Idiom lessons.
  - Improve team communication
- Retirement fund.

##### Access to a re-investment fund

Allow core developers to receive money to be spent within the Neo community.

- Used to purchase tokens, NFTs, and other items.
  - Aim to connect core devs with the results of their work.
  - Stimulate the internal market.
  - Identify usability issues and bottlenecks in wallets, explorers, and other auxiliary services.
  - Increase the supply of nodes in testnet and other services.

##### Cover for Cloud Computing Expenses

Used to put developers close to their tech and increase service offerings (testnet nodes, etc.)

- Allow core devs to maintain computational services without personal expenses.
- Enable core devs to conduct experiments without additional costs.


##### Compensation from Community Contributors

If a core developer is part of a community, the compensation should be given to an address appointed by the community representative.
- This is important to ensure communities stay united and under their governance and compensation model.
- This allows communities to follow legal procedures in their residing countries.

##### Inclusion and Termination
Discussed privately by Core Developers. Managed by NGD.

- Can't make decisions that are in disagreement with this policy.

##### Retirement
Core developers may become eligible for a permanent membership.
- Minimum 10 years of relevant contributions.
- Access to the retirement fund.

#### Technical Committee
